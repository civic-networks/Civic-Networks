# 7 Ways we help build communities

We're here to help social entrepreneurs create and maintain healthy online communities. Here are seven kinds of assistance we offer: 

### 1. Fundraising (priming the pump)

As a nonprofit, we solicit donations working directly with individual donors and indirectly through crowdfunding platforms. These funds are used to operate our networks while we develop sustainable commercial operations that provide both stable, long-term funding for operations. 

### 2. Software

All our communities will build on a shared library of open source social network software. The software is flexible enough to implement a wide variety of community types and support a wide range of community rules. Building on a common framework reduces costs and lets communities interconnect.

### 3. Hosting

All communities use common services hosted on the same cloud environment. As with common code, using a common platform lets us serve more people at a lower cost, without needing a massive team.

### 4. Community management guidance and tools

To help communities select policies to govern themselves, we've developed a collection of policy modules that cover things like membership, identity, suspension, etc. These can be combined like lego blocks to meet each community's specific needs. 

### 5. Community building

We help communities find and recruit members through a variety of means, including:

- cross-community promotion
- cross-community registration 
- assistance with the development of promotional media and materials
- developing a shared base of of community building expertise 

### 6. Advertising and Commerce

Operating a modern social network is wildly expensive. To ensure that our communities are self-sustaining, each is supported by our advertising system. Over time, this system will grow to incorporate a shared library of advertising software, ad-serving operations, and access to our network of advertisers.

### 7. Charity evaluation and giving

We research charities and to ensure that surplus funds are donated to those with track records of effectively addressing the world's most pressing problems in the most efficient way.
