# Concerns

## Surveillance

Surveillance is a major concern in social networks, as these networks have significant amounts of user information including:

- Personal information
  - name, contact info, location, contacts, 
  - a history of interactions within the network

## Coercion & Manipulation

### Addiction

A frequent complaint about social networks is the they are designed to keep users 'engaged' in app as long as possible. This involves techniques like variable rewards, notifications of contact activity, etc.

One reason for the concern is that time spent social networking might be wasted. 

### Economic

Economic manipulation involves the use of sophisticated algorithms and design applied to further the commercial interests of advertisers and of the site itself. 

One element of economic coercion is that the *terms of use* and *privacy policies* that members agree to, are deliberately made excessively long, and as incomprehensible as possible. They are frequently updated, and they are don't represent a 'fair deal' for the user.  

### Political

Unlike the issues of addiction and economic manipulation, political manipulation generally involves the use of the platform by third parties to influence political opinions and outcomes. This influence may involve the use of political advertising, or it may involve the use of trolls, bots, and political operatives on the site. 

One common technique is to create and spread false statements. See fake news.
