# Networks

This is a collection of social network concepts

Please note: For now, all names below are project names. None of them have been vetted for use in an actual social network.

## edge

**Status: edge** is the most developed idea, and for many reasons the most attractive candidate for an initial network.

### User profiles

Jess is a straight, single freshman at Mount Holyoke in the South Hadley, Massachusetts who plans to major in biology. She's a member of the College Democrats, having joined due to concerns about Donald Trump, but is not especially active. Having grown up in Connecticut, she has a limited social network at school. She is not religious. She'd like to get know students at the other local colleges, including UMASS Amherst, and Amherst College, to have more to do on weekends, and potentially to meet men for dating.

Brian is a straight male student at Baylor University  in Waco Texas, a Christian University. He majors in accounting and follows the school's Division 1 football and basketball teams. He's a member of a fraternity and is active in his church.  Last summer he travelled to central America as part of a mission focused on helping impoverished children in Honduras.

### Features/Details

edge has the following features

- Invite only
- Real Identities/Names only, validated (initially) by .edu email address from an approved school is required
- Bi-directional friend relationships
- Bounded invites. (depth)
- Supports connections via 
  - schools/campuses
  - clubs, greek orgs, 
  - dorms/houses, etc.
  - courses/majors

### Rationale

College students:

- More idealistic
- Open to change
- **A vital source of builders for Civic Networks (designers, media producers, coders, AI specialists, etc. )**
- **Strong, bounded, real-world social networks.**
- Heavy social network users
- Easy-to-control rollout (school-by-school) enables scaling, adjusting/pivoting, handling technical issues, 
- Monetizable. An attractive demographic for advertisers who want to establish and strengthen lifetime brand relationships
- Strong incentive to good behavior 

### Launch program

The rollout will proceed in three steps

1. Launch school: A single college or university will be selected for the initial launch. Ideally, signups at this school would reach 50% of the students, and MAU would be 80%. During the launch, multiple versions of the software would be rolled out as feedback is gathered. 
2. Targeted schools: A collection of approximately a dozen additional schools will be targeted for rollout, individually or in small groups of schools in the same geographic area. The consortium schools in Amherst, Philadelphia, and CA (Pomona?) might be good targets for groups. Individual schools would be selected based on their utility as springboards: e.g. Ivy league schools, women's schools, traditionally black schools. Large state universities. 
3. General rollout: Upon success of the targeted rollout, the network will be rolled out to individually to other US schools as the waiting list for the school reaches 20% of the total student body.

## IMHO (IMO?)

An interest-oriented community (like Twitter, or Google+).

### Rationale

In some ways, Twitter is an ideal candidate. It's a highly politicized environment with significant problems (harassment, hate groups, bots, trolls, fake-news, etc.), not least of which is serving as the preferred propaganda tool for Trump. A large number of users may have been driven off of the platform by harassment, by the frequently negative tone of discourse, or simply because it's a time sink. On the other hand, it has become a preferred platform for artists and other influencers to reach their communities, and is ubiquitous as a publicity mechanism and content distribution channel for traditional media.

- It might be the easiest to setup. 
- Twitter has relatively few features compared to other networks. 
- Not as demanding (cost-wise) as a more media-rich platform like TikTok or Instagram.
- If influencers could be convinced to join, their followers would, well, follow. 
- It is unbounded in terms of growth and could potentially exploit traditional media more readily than a closed network like edge.

### Concerns

- It doesn't leverage real world social networks other than celebrity/fan networks.
- For many regular users, outrage may be more of a feature than a bug.
- Influencers/Celebrities need to be brought on board 
- Public posts could cause future reputational damage
- It is highly embedded as the channel for traditional media
- The user community would have limited overlap with **edge**
- How to 
  - avoid having hate groups and trolls join
  - keep the conversation civil

### Features

- identity
- public posts, with optional expiration dates
- media types: short text, with link, video, image. meme
- groups are porous (tags can serve as a grouping mechanism, but don't restrict posts to a community)
- comments and reactions
- comment moderation?
- one-way relationships
- direct messaging
- profiles

Specialty tools/features

- Duel posting to twitter (and facebook)?
- Sign on with twitter (for verified customers only?)
- Post buttons for third-party sites
