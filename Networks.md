# Networks

This is a collection of social network concepts

Please note: For now, all names below are project names. None of them have been vetted for use in an actual social network.



## edge

**Status: edge** is the most developed idea, and for many reasons the most attractive candidate for an initial network.



### User profile

Jess is a college student in the United States with an interest in social causes, including climate change. 



### Features/Details

edge has the following features

- Real Identities/Names only (see next item)
- Validated by .edu email address from an approved school is required
- Bi-directional friend relationships
- Supports connections via 
  - schools/campuses
  - clubs, greek orgs, 
  - dorms/houses, etc.
  - courses/majors



### Rationale

College students:

- More idealistic
- Open to change
- **A vital source of builders for Civic Networks (designers, media producers, coders, AI specialists, etc. )**
- **Strong, bounded, real-world social networks.**
- Heavy social network users
- Easy-to-control rollout (school-by-school) enables scaling, adjusting/pivoting, handling technical issues, 
- Monetizable. An attractive demographic for advertisers who want to establish and strengthen lifetime brand relationships
- Strong incentive to good behavior 

Traditional style network



### About the name

## IMHO (IMO?)

An interest-oriented community (like Twitter, or Google+)



### User Profile





### Rationale

- In some ways this would be the easiest to setup. 
- Twitter has relatively few features compared to other networks. 
- Not as demanding (cost-wise) as a more media-rich platform like TikTok or Instagram.
- If influencers could be convinced to join, their followers would, well, follow. 
- It is unbounded in terms of growth and could potentially exploit traditional media more readily than a closed network like edge.
