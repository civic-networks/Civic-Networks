# Civic Networks

Civic Networks is an umbrella organization for a family of social networks that benefit society. These networks use ethical advertising programs to convert online fun into money, and convert money into social good.

Here's how it works:

**First, we will be organized as a 501(c)(3)** **nonprofit**. That means "going public", selling to Facebook, or any other get-rich-quick schemes are off the table. Our goal is to do the most good, but we operate like a for-profit in applying modern technology, media strategies, etc. to support our mission. 

**We provide infrastructure for building and operating social networks.** That includes software and hosting. Tools for monitoring and analysis. Assistance with recruitment, and access to a shared network of advertisers and ad-tech. By sharing this infrastructure across multiple networks we can lower our costs. 

**There a many ways to participate.** Broadly speaking, we think of people as members in one or more communities. 

1. **Builders** help design, build and operate our software, create advertising and business strategies, produce media, write copy, develop analytics, support donors, select charities, and assist our members.  
2. **Activists** apply a wide variety of tools and techniques to publicize, evangelize, and advocate for, and ultimately mobilize others to build our networks. 
3. **Members** participate in one or more of our networks. They may choose to participate in our advertising programs, make donations to our charities, or otherwise provide support, but many will just be here to socialize. And that's fine.
4. **Donors** keep the lights on while we grow and develop transactional revenues. 
5. **Advertisers** are businesses that want to align their brands with, and communicate with their customers on, the social network that is making the world a better place.  
6. **Neighbors** are our friends, acquaintances, and passersby. Some we know and some we'll never know. Some aren't even born yet. But they share this planet with us and with all other creatures. Our goal is ultimately to make our own lives a little better, by making all of theirs a little better.

You have a place in at least one of these communities.

**Our networks will take different forms**. Some might be serious, others just for the lulz. One may be more like Snapchat, others more like LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, or even TikTok. Some may be like nothing you've seen. We don't know which will be most successful, but to paraphrase Dickens, we want each to be 

> a good place: a kind, forgiving, charitable, pleasant place: one where men and women seem to open their shut-up hearts freely, and to think of others as if they really were fellow passengers to the grave, and not another race of creatures bound on other journeys.

**Our charities address the world’s hardest problems in the most cost effective ways**: Things like saving children's lives by providing vitamin supplements. We're also *incredibly* interested in finding cost-effective ways to protect the planet from climate change and other dangers.

**Our advertising network and technology will support our communities, and our charities.** Enormous amounts of money are being made in online advertising. Facebook alone earned over \$20 billion in profit last year. But a social network is made of people. Ultimately it should benefit people.  

**We despise the relentless surveillance of advertising technology** as widely applied today. We recognize, however the many goods supported by ads. And we don't mean just a pretty good search engine. Here are some others:

- The publication of Edward Snowden's revelations about NSA surveillance of U.S. citizens and foreign officials.
- Ronan Farrow's expose on Harvey Weinstein's alleged abuses. 
- The Boston Globe's Spotlight reporting on sexual abuse by Catholic priests. 
- Walter Cronkite on network TV telling America the Vietnam War could not be won. 

Relieved of the pressure for ever-higher stock prices, advertising can be an effective, ethical way to fund social programs. 

**We're transparent, and our doors are open**

All internally developed software will be open source. As a non-profit, our financials will also be open. 

Last, but certainly not least, participation in our networks will be free of charge, and participation in our advertising programs will be optional. We believe that many people will welcome (or at least tolerate) advertising when by doing so, they're saving lives.  

**How can I help?**

We thought you’d never ask. We need expert programmers, designers, AI specialists, advertising managers, community leaders, and on and on. And by expert, we mean smart, dedicated people who want to become experts. 

That's all for now. We'll be publishing more information on how this all works very soon.
