#Organization

Civic Networks is a 501(c)3 nonprofit corporation located near Boston Massachusetts.

The people of Civic Networks are building the infrastructure, technology, organization and policies needed to establish online communities, places where people can talk, laugh, argue, and share with each other, safely.



Because people are complex, with an infinite variety of interests, loves, and fears, we provide places where they can talk about work, interact with family, laugh with friends. 



In the real world people don't shout everything that comes into their head at everyone they know. They have some conversations with family, some with neighbors, some with colleagues or fellow hobbyists. In each group, some facet of the participants comes to the fore. Interaction styles differ. 

So we're not making one social network. We're making a network of them. Each has its own unique look, vibe, policies, norms. 

To get started, we've organized as a nonprofit and begun raise funds. We work directly with individual donors and indirectly through crowdfunding. 

Gathering this seed money is our first contribution

All our communities will build on a shared library of social network software. All will run in the same cloud environment. 

Providing this technology is our second contribution.

All of these communities will be supported by a shared library of advertising technology. All will have access to the same  network of advertisers.

Providing a sustainable funding mechanism is our third contribution.

Money from donations, and money generated by advertising will be applied first to supporting the communities. Surplus funds will be donated to charities with the greatest record of effectively addressing the world's most pressing problems in the most efficient way. 

Directing funds to where they're most useful is our fourth contribution

We developed a collection of modular policy elements, covering things like membership rules, to manage individual communities 

Providing a learning environment
