## Why multiple communities

Because people have an infinite variety of interests, loves, beliefs, and fears, we provide places where they can talk about work, interact with family, laugh with friends. 

People don't have the same conversation with everyone they know. Some conversations are with family, some with neighbors, some with colleagues or fellow hobbyists. In each group, a particular facet of each member comes to the fore. What is discussed differs; Interaction styles differ. 

So we're not making one social network. We're making a network of them. Each has its own unique look, vibe, policies, norms, people. You decide which is for you.
