## Community Platform Formation

Communities enter Civic Networks through the incubator and graduate to Community Project status after meeting certain requirements. Communities eligible for Incubator membership, can be eithe new communities, or communities on other platforms that are interested in moving to improve their members experience and support our mission. 

Note that these new community platforms are really new platforms. That is, they are for communities that 'don't fit' on an existing Civic Networks platform because the rules and policies on that platform are incompatible with the desired member experience. For example, a platform organized around geographic location where people were encouraged to 'friend' their nearest neighbors would be poorly supported on a network like TikTok. In this case the new platform might make sense. As a counter-example, If we had a strong network of cat enthusiasts on a Twitter-like platform, and you want to create a similar network for dogs, you would likely be better of organizing a dog community on the existing platform than building an entirely new platform.

#### Community Incubator

All communities begin in the Community Incubator 



#### Incubator Application Process

Social entrepreneurs who would like to develop new communities are invited to apply for membership to the Incubator. 



## Why multiple communities

Because people have an infinite variety of interests, loves, beliefs, and fears, we provide places where they can talk about work, interact with family, laugh with friends. 

People don't have the same conversation with everyone they know. Some conversations are with family, some with neighbors, some with colleagues or fellow hobbyists. In each group, a particular facet of each member comes to the fore. What is discussed differs; Interaction styles differ. 

So we're not making one social network. We're making a network of them. Each has its own unique look, vibe, policies, norms, people. You decide which is for you.
