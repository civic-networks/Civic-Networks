# What Is Civic Networks?

To explain what Civic Network is, we first need to answer a simpler question: What is Facebook?

There are a lot of reasonable answers. You could say it's

- A social network
- A giant corporation
- An ad-tech phenomenon
- A surveillance nightmare

To us, Facebook is a machine that turns instinctual drive to socialize into money. Of course it's not just socializing that goes into it. There was investment capital. It takes money to make money after all. For Facebook, it also takes ads. And it took a big effort by some extraordinarily talented people. 

So the Facebook machine takes socializing and turns it into money. Almost unimaginable amounts of money. By some counts there are more than a dozen "Facebook billionaires." Mark Zuckerberg alone is worth $38 billion. 

But like any machine it doesn't just produce what you want. There are by-products. And they're not pretty. They're not healthy. Bullying, it's a vector not just just for cat videos, but for lies, conspiracy theories, propaganda. To some, Facebook is a threat to democracy in the US and elsewhere. 

So that's Facebook. What is Civic Networks?

Have you seen *The Man in the High Castle*? No? Well, spoiler alert. The man in the High Castle is a world with two universes. In one, the Nazis win WW2. In the other, they lose. 

Civic networks is Facebook in another universe. 

Like the real Facebook, it's an engine that turns social interaction into money. Here's how it's different. 



The second difference is that the Facebook machine is opaque. It's a black box. How it works, the algorithms, the moderation AI, the strategies, are all hidden. With Civic Networks, the software is out in the open....

The third difference is who does the work. 

The fourth difference is how the advertising works.

The fifth difference is that the CNI machine runs cleaner. There are fewer noxious byproducts. 

Finally, CNI is a non-profit with a social mission ...

Let me give you an example. 

In sum, Facebook is a giant tech corporation that operates social networks largely for the benefit of a few extraordinarily rich people and a somewhat larger number of extraordinarily well paid employees. Civic Networks is a non-profit that operates social networks for the benefit of their members and for all the world's people, but especially the poorest and least powerful.
